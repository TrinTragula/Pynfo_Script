# Pynfo_Script
A useful python script to understand how much your connections tell (and how anonymous you are). Check and see if you are who you want to be! 

**DISCLAIMER:**

The score is assigned based on getipintel.net, in order to know how suspicious your ip appears to a random website. So *please remember* to use your own email address for the API requests to the website. The hardcoded one it's just a placeholder.
